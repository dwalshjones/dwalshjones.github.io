  <h2>Identity and Values</h2>
  <p>
    A lot of my Identity comes from my childhood. It's not something I intentionally think about
    but as I've grown up I've found that it's effected my identiy and values more than I could
    have even imagined.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been very lucky to be in a privileged and supportive environment but a large part of the
    begining of it was filled with a lot of fighting and screaming. My parents divorced when I was
    around 5 years old. One of my very first memories is my older sister and I hunkered down in
    what was at the time our dining room, our parents arguing in the next room until my sister,
    who couldn't have been older than around 12 or 13, yelled for them to stop. </p>

  <p>When I was 23, I worked for a consumer e-scooter rental business, dropping off scooters
    around Auckland City. It wasn't anything fancy but it gave me something to do instead of
    staying at home all day. It was on this job that I had my life threatened for the first, and
    hopefully last time. I was on an Auckland street, dropping of scooters like I usually did when
    I heard a couple arguing in the street. The woman seemed really frighted by the man who was
    with her, so I didn't move on to my next spot. Until, admittedly stupidly, I placed myself between them when he went
    to strike her. I was moved away by a passerby who, obviously overhearing the man threaten to pull his gun on me.</p>

  <p>My strengths identity is deeply intrenched in doing the right thing, even if it's the tough thing. I think about that moment
    a lot, not because it makes me feel some kind of heroism but because I don't know what ended up happening to that
    woman. By the time the police arrived, they had driven off.</p>
