      <h2>Identity and Values</h2>

      <h3>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that
        decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h3>

        I've been very lucky to be in a privileged and supportive environment but a large part of the begining of it was filled
        with a lot of fighting and screaming. My parents divorced when I was around 5 years old. One of my very first memories is
        my older sister and I hunkered down in what was at the time our dining room, our parents arguing in the next room until my
        sister, who couldn't have been older than around 12 or 13, yelled for them to stop.

        When I was 23, I worked for a consumer e-scooter rental business, dropping off scooters around Auckland City. It wasn't
        anything fancy but it gave me something to do instead of staying at home all day. It was on this job that I had my life
        threatened for the first, and hopefully last time. I was on an Auckland street, dropping of scooters like I usually did
        when I heard a couple arguing in the street. The woman seemed really frighted by the man who was with her, so I didn't
        move on to my next spot. Until, admittedly stupidly, I placed myself between them when he went to strike her. I was moved
        away by a passerby who, obviously overhearing the man threaten to pull his gun on me. My strengths identity is deeply
        intrenched in doing the right thing, even if it's the tough thing. I think about that moment a lot, not because it makes
        me feel some kind of heroism but because I don't know what ended up happening to that woman. By the time the police
        arrived, they had driven off.

        Growing up in a house with yelling and auguring, my values are deeply intrenched in doing the right thing, even if it's
        the tough thing. I think about that moment a lot, not because it makes me feel some kind of heroism but because I don't
        know what ended up happening to that woman. By the time the police arrived, they had driven off.

      <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning</h3>
      <p>
        When something interests me, it all I'll focus on, sometimes for hours at a time. Web Development is something that I'm
        really passionate about, so this will put me in good stead to learn.

      <h3>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I feel that a lot of my limitations come down to my ability to commit to one thing, where I just let the
        negative aspects of a learning experience or job overtake me and then burn out.</p>
        
        <h3>An example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
        time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <p>Working in Customer Service, there is always tension when a customer can't get the solution they were after. Talking through alternative solutions or options is always my go to. As my mother always says "Don't stop at the problem, find the solution.</p>
