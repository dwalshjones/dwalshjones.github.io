		<h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
		<p>
			I'm not sure what I want my long term goal to be but I know that I want to change the world in some way. Having
			spent a
			large amount of my life so far surrounded by computers, I'd like to become a full-stack developer and change the
			world
			through technology.
		</p>

		<h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
		<p>
			I'm really great at getting something done if I really set my mind to it. My main limitation is that if I get
			stuck on
			something, I'll usually just dismiss it and get distracted by something else. I am my own worst enemy, and a large
			part of
			that comes down to my fear of failure and of letting others down. I've recently come to the realization that a lot
			of the
			self sabotaging I do comes from a place of the fear that I won't be able to fix the problem so I don't even bother
			starting to try.
		</p>

		<h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
		</h3>

		<p>
			Definitely my time management, it's something that I know I really struggle with and need to work on. I'd also
			like to
			develop my leadership skills as I'd like to work in leadership roles in the future.
		</p>

		<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>

		<h5>
			This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other
			learners,
			Facilitators and industry/community representatives
		</h5>
		<h5>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h5>

		<p>
			I have set myself up a office that is specifically for studying, I also have three monitors so I can keep my
			workload
			across these screens. I've also recently started on a ADHD medication to help myself focus and stay on track.
			<br><br>
			Imposter syndrome is something that I've dealt with for a really long time so asking for help has always been
			difficult
			for me as I feel like if I do, I'm just proving that I shouldn't be where I am. I'm working on being more honest
			about
			this with myself and with others.
		</p>

		<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
		<p>
			Not asking for help has caused me to withdraw from this course once already, I'm commited to making sure that
			doesn't
			happen again.
		</p>

		<h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
		<p>
			I think my only expectation is to understand that not every student is going to be the same and that struggling to
			ask for
			help isn't the same as not wanting it.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might
			have
			whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
		</h3>
		<p>I'm child free so no school drop offs for me!</p>
