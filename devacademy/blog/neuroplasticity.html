		<h3>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h3>
		<p>
			As mentioned in Carol Dweck's Ted Talk and their study in the journal Child Development, at a fundamental level,
			simply
			knowing that intelligence isn't just something you're born with and you're stuck at whatever part of the race you
			started
			at is. It gives the motivation that if you continue honing a skill or knowledge, your brain can still change, and
			the
			understanding that doing this work is what helps create these stronger synapses. <br> <br> It's also a benefit to
			know that this
			plasticity does reduce as we age, so it allows the self-acceptance that older brains won't have the same outcomes
			as
			younger ones, but that doesn't mean it's not beneficial, understanding that repetition, undertaking the same
			practise,
			again and again, is still a significant part of having a more remarkable outcome.
		</p>
		<h3>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h3>
		<p>I'm definitely not as young as I was when I was in my learning prime; even at 25, there are still times when I
			have to take a minute
			and think harder about a task I'm working on or why I'm continuing to try to get a different outcome with a method
			that hasn't worked
			three times previously but looking at the principles of neuroplasticity it seems to me that even these, what some
			might call,
			redundant actions and still having a benefit on my brain it's still firing the same synapses, so they don't
			weaken. <br> <br>
			As my neuroplasticity starts to wane, the way I'd like to engage with the principles of neuroplasticity is one of
			self-acceptance.
			Although a lot tougher than when I was a teenager, each step is still helping my brain make those connections.
			<br><br> When I used to go to the gym, I would always see
			older people in their 60s and 70s who would just absolutely be ripped, and I was amazed that at their age, they
			were still
			able to be that fit and lift more than me, at the time a freshly 20 something. To me, that's what the principles
			of
			neuroplasticity come down to; it's continuing to show up and lift a heavy mental load, day after day after day.
