		<h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>
		<h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
			due to the core learning?</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				I am so damn hard on myself, honestly I've never met someone so
				viciously against themselves.<br />
				I need to work on not comparing myself to others because everyone is
				going to be at there own speed and if I do feel like I'm ahead then I
				need to put my ego aside and do something about it.
			</li>
			<br />
			<li>I really like listening to people and making them feel heard. I
				constantly try and reflect what the other person is saying but sometimes
				all I need to do is just listen.</li>
			<br />
			<li>I'm not done learning and it's not too late to. My mind is a changing,
				growing thing and the best thing to help myself is feed it with positive
				reinforcements, not negative self talk</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
			programming?</h3>
		<p>
			Each of these traits intertwine with each other, we bring our values into
			our learning and into how we program, they allow us to prioritise what is
			most important to us but empathy allows us to change and adapt our values
			those around us, understanding that our values don't effect just
			overselves but the people that we learn and program with. It is only by
			being self-aware that we can fully empathise by putting ourselves in their
			shoes.
		</p>
		<h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
		<p>
			How much the way we act and our values effect our work and our
			relationships. They're all very ingrained concepts that in a world of
			stress and worry we've brushed to the side.
		</p>
		<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
		<p>Confronting the worst parts of myself, the parts that quite frequently
			are the parts that cause me pain and therefore effect those around me.
			Feeling less than everyone else isn't something that we're born with, it's
			something that we're pick up and then continue to tell ourselves.</p>
		<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
			focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
		<p>
			So much of programming requires using your brain and being fully present,
			by having the skills to empathise with others and be self aware allows us
			to be more adaptive and less prone to alienating others and burning out.
		</p>

		<h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
			time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
			Justify your answer.</h3>
		<p>Honestly, I totally thought this at the beginning of foundations. I was
			so committed to trying to be the best that I set myself up for failure.
			The moment I viewed myself as lesser or not good as another classmate, I
			faltered. I thought what was the point of even continuing if I was just
			going to end up in someone else's shadow. <strong>That</strong> is why
			core learning is important. It allowed me to continue on going once I got
			to that negative dip by coming to terms with the fact that it is okay not
			to be the best. I needed to be able to learn that programming is not just
			for myself but for my
			team.</p>
