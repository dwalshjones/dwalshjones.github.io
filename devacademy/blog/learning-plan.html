		<h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
		<p>
			I'm not sure what I want my long term goal to be but I know that I want to
			change the world in some way. Having
			spent a
			large amount of my life so far surrounded by computers, I'd like to become
			a full-stack developer and change the
			world
			through technology.
		</p>

		<h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
			learning</h3>
		<p>
			I'm really great at getting something done if I really set my mind to it.
			My main limitation is that if I get
			stuck on
			something, I'll usually just dismiss it and get distracted by something
			else. I am my own worst enemy, and a large
			part of
			that comes down to my fear of failure and of letting others down. I've
			recently come to the realization that a lot
			of the
			self sabotaging I do comes from a place of the fear that I won't be able
			to fix the problem so I don't even bother
			starting to try.
		</p>

		<h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
			developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
		</h3>

		<p>
			Definitely my time management, it's something that I know I really
			struggle with and need to work on. I'd also
			like to
			develop my leadership skills as I'd like to work in leadership roles in
			the future.
		</p>

		<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
		</h3>

		<h5>
			This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
			work productively and safely with other
			learners,
			Facilitators and industry/community representatives
		</h5>
		<h5>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
		</h5>

		<p>
			I have set myself up a office that is specifically for studying, I also
			have three monitors so I can keep my
			workload
			across these screens. I've also recently started on a ADHD medication to
			help myself focus and stay on track.
			<br><br>
			Imposter syndrome is something that I've dealt with for a really long time
			so asking for help has always been
			difficult
			for me as I feel like if I do, I'm just proving that I shouldn't be where
			I am. I'm working on being more honest
			about
			this with myself and with others.
		</p>

		<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
		<p>
			Not asking for help has caused me to withdraw from this course once
			already, I'm commited to making sure that
			doesn't
			happen again.
		</p>

		<h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
		<p>
			I think my only expectation is to understand that not every student is
			going to be the same and that struggling to
			ask for
			help isn't the same as not wanting it.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
			to other things. For example, you might
			have
			whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
		</h3>
		<p>I'm child free so no school drop offs for me!</p>

	<h1 class="blog-heading">My Learning Plan - 5/10/2022</h1>

	<h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
	<p>
		I'd like to create something that makes people's lives better, in the past
		years the world has just gotten angrier and angrier and I don't know how but
		I'd like to be a part of the solution. Computers and websites have the
		greatest outreach so this is the way that I'd like to change the world for
		the better.
	</p>

	<h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
	</h3>
	<p>
		I'm getting better at not comparing myself to others but it's still
		definitely one of my limitations, I'm trying to learn that I do not have to
		be the main person in the room to be happy with my progress. My strength is
		that I really like listening to people so I can see where they're coming
		from.
		I'm also learning to ask for more help when I need it but trying through an
		issue myself first but I'm learning that a load carried together is a lot
		lighter.
	</p>

	<h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
		be?</h3>
	<p>
		I think definitely still my time management, I've developed little skills
		and workarounds to offset this but I'd still really like to meet and set
		deadlines. I think also asking for help will still play a minor role but I'm
		definitely getting better at it.
	</p>

	<h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed
		in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
	<p>I've never felt confident or that I had the personal skills to be able to
		lead a team, fearing that I'd let them down so why even bother. I'd really
		like to work and learn how to lead a team and help them to success and/or
		through failure.</p>

	<h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
	<p>I'd really like pretty frequent feedback, I think that's largely where I
		struggled in bootcamp is that I didn't have an indication on whether or not
		I was doing well or what I could improve on so I felt like nothing I was
		doing was right.</p>

	<h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
	<p>I would like to be able to balance by personal and learning life better and
		I think this largely comes from regularly being in contact with both sides
		so neither struggle. I've discussed the workload that I'll be doing with my
		partner in a effort for us both to understand what's expected of me.</p>
