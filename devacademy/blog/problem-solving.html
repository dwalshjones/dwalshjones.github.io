		<h3>Tell me about a time when you were blocked on a simple problem?</h3>
		<p>
			I found myself getting really blocked on problems that involved both looping and joining together, such as the
			capitalize sentence that required you to remove the first letter of each word, capitalize it and then re-add the
			letter back to
			the rest of the word.<br><br>I originally found pseudocode to be really annoying, having to plan out what I'd do
			first and then coding instead of figuring it out as I went (which in all honesty is still my preferred method) but
			as I struggled along with the task, I found it really helpful to break down the problem in to the steps I'd need
			to follow and have a better idea of where to go from there. <br><br> At times I felt really hopeless, like I
			should just give up and find a different career path because obviously web development was not for me but once I
			took a step away, cleared my head and came back to the task at hand, I found that my head was a lot clearer and
			with a little googling of how different methods can be used, I
			could fully process what the task was asking of me. <br><br> I learnt that there are many different ways to solve
			a problem in JavaScript but more often than not, breaking it down into the same way that you'd process the steps
			of any other issue is usually the most straight forward way of getting there.
		</p>
		<h3>What about a time where you elegantly solved a problem?</h3>
		<p>I'd never attempted one of the stretch assignments, usually feeling too burnt out or tired to try but this time
			around I really enjoyed going the JavaScript olympics, it was the perfect mix of difficult and creative,
			especially with the interactivity going on.
			<br> <br> I felt I solved two of the problems on the stretch really elegantly, Jumble your Words, which involved
			taking reversed words, splitting
			them in individual characters and then reverse and rejoining the words, and Odds Out, removing numbers that
			weren't even numbers (as in Even and Odd). I felt I solved really
			elegantly and actually felt like I understood what was happening in the code, and that largely came down to using
			pseudocode to break down what I wanted the outcome to be and how I'd get there. Having interactive error messages
			really helped me to understand where I was going wrong and pointed me in the right direction.
		</p>
		<h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Pseudocode: </strong>My strongest enemy and my greatest ally. I really struggle with not jumping straight
			into the actual coding side of things but Pseudocoding has been really helpful in keeping all my thoughts in one
			place, I feel like I'll being using this a lot more in the future.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Trying something: </strong>This is usually my go to approach, just throwing things at the issue and seeing
			what sticks. I'm confident with it but I don't think it's the most efficient way of solving a problem.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Rubber Ducky Method: </strong> I specifically went out to kmart to buy a rubber duck to help me code, it's
			fabulous, it's glittery and
			honestly...it's become more of a stress toy than anything else. There have been times where it's briefly helped,
			more than anything having a laugh at the fact that I'm talking to a rubber duck helps clear my head which in turn
			helps with problem solving side of things. Not exactly it's intended purpose but I'm willing to continue trying it
			out.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Reading error messages: </strong>This has been really helpful with finding exactly where issues in my code
			are otherwise I'd just be spending hours searching blindly though my code. Definitely a skill that I'll be making
			more use of in the future.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Googling: </strong>Googling is definitely a double edge sword, it can be really helpful in some cases but
			in others all I can find it people solving the issue in a completely different way to the way that we've been
			asked to, it's good for learning specific methods but not so much how to use those methods.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong>Honestly this is the scariest problem-solving technique for me, I
			feel like I'm not as good as my peers and that they'll judge me if I'm not at the same level as them, even if
			that's definitely not the case. I look at the other people on the course and feel like I'm not as good because I'm
			not working as fast as them. A few days ago I saw a video on a phenomenon called Learned Helplessness and it
			really hit home for me. Once I see that I'm not as good as my peers, I tend to not want to work as hard. I'm
			working really hard on this and hopefully it'll be easier when we're in person.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong>I'm definitely getting better at this, the coaches at Dev are really
			helpful without being condescending or just giving me the answer so I still feel like I'm doing the work myself
			but that I'm just getting pointed in the right direction. I'm still slightly hesitant to ask for help because I
			feel like if I do I'm admitting that I don't deserve to be here but I'm definitely improving.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong> I have moments where I find myself reflecting on how to
			make the process easier if I had to go through it again and I feel this helps with the next time I'm faced with a
			similar problem but at the moment I haven't felt in a situation where I've felt my process didn't get me to where
			I wanted to be.
