    <h3>
      What is Emotional Intelligence?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence is the connection that one has to not only their own emotions but the emotions of others.
      Some examples of forms this come are:
      <ul>
        <li>Empathy - The ability to understand and share the feelings of another person</li>
        <li>Emotional regulation - The ability to review, control and express one's own emotions</li>
        <li>Confidence in and acceptance of self - I view this as understanding that your thoughts, feelings and
          behaviours are lead by your own personal morals and not by outsider opinion.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      IQ is the connection between one's ability to comprehend complex tasks requiring quantitative reasoning and a
      understanding of the other concepts. EQ is the connection between individuals and also of the self, it requires a
      deeper understanding, that can't easily be taught in books but instead requires connect between people and a deep
      look inside yourself.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Why is it important?
    </h3>
    <p>Emotional Intelligence has a impact on almost every aspect of your own life and has the butterfly effect for
      those around you.
      <br>
      <br>
      Daniel Goleman, the journalist and psychologist who popularised the concept, has stated that
      emotional intelligence has noted that a large part of emotional intelligence is attuning to your emotions allows
      your to learn from and manage them so they don't impact you or social relationships. He has also noted that
      studies now show that emotional intelligence has a major impact on not onlu anti-social and social but also on
      academic behavior, previously believed to be purely intellect based. </p>
