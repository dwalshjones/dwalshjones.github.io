    <h1 class="blog-heading">My Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>
      I'm not sure what I want my long term goal to be but I know that I want to change the world in
      some way. Having spent a large amount of my life so far surrounded by computers, I'd like to
      become a full-stack developer and change the world through technology.
    </p>

    <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
    <p>
      I'm really great at getting something done if I really set my mind to it. My main limitation
      is that if I get stuck on something, I'll usually just dismiss it and get distracted by
      something else. I am my own worst enemy, and a large part of that comes down to my fear of
      failure and of letting others down. I've recently come to the realization that a lot of the
      self sabotaging I do comes from a place of the fear that I won't be able to fix the problem so
      I don't even bother starting to try.

    <h2>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself
      while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Definitely my time management, it's something that I know I really struggle with and need to
      work on. I'd also like to develop my leadership skills as I'd like to work in leadership roles
      in the future.

    <h2>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
    </h2>

    <h3>
      An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other
      learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
    </h3>
    <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>

    <p>
      I have set myself up a office that is specifically for studying, I also have three monitors so
      I can keep my workload across these screens. I've also recently started on a ADHD medication
      to help myself focus and stay on track. Imposter syndrome is something that I've dealt with
      for a really long time so asking for help has always been difficult for me as I feel like if I
      do, I'm just proving that I shouldn't be where I am. I'm working on being more honest about
      this with myself and with others.
    </p>

    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
    <p>
      Not asking for help has caused me to withdraw from this course once already, I'm commited to
      making sure that doesn't happen again.
    </p>

    <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      I think my only expectation is to understand that not every student is going to be the same
      and that struggling to ask for help isn't the same as not wanting it.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For
      example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these
      in.
    </h2>
    <p>I'm luckily child free so no school drop offs for me!</p>
